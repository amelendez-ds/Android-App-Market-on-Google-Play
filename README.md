# Android App Market on Google Play

## Description
*Data Camp* project for deploying insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention. It is a basic project to get familiar with **importing datasets**, as well as **cleaning** and **visualising data**. 

## Data
The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. The data files are as follows:

- **apps.csv**: information of Google Play Apps. There are 13 features per app.
- **user_reviews.csv**: contains 100 reviews for each app. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: `Sentiment` (Positive, Negative or Neutral), `Sentiment Polarity` and `Sentiment Subjectivity`.

## Notebook
The notebook comprehends the whole project and is self-contained when the datasets are loaded. Each of its 9 steps has a description on what is being done in the section.
